            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <hr>
            <img src="assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" alt="Javier Ordonez" id="about-image">
            <p>I am very fond of storytelling. My ideal job involves weaving stories of dream and fact that express what people love and are proud of most about themselves. And that's what I do.</p>
            <p>I was born and raised in Dallas, but I learned what it feels like to starve, study, and spend your first paycheck at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I primarily worked with digital wind tunnel simulations for sports cars, varied criticism of contemporary media, and terrible student films. Mostly terrible student films.</p>
            <p>For two years, I worked in New York at a now-closed Japanese coffeehouse, a prestigious film production company, and a photography studio. I spent the time taking classes at NYU and learning graphic design from scratch. I ate a donut beside Maggie Gyllenhaal once.</p>
            <p>Now, I am the Creative Director at Aliento de Vida Ministries, a mid-sized church in the heart of Dallas where I grew up. By day, I spend every hour weaving into film, digital image, and audio the stories that mean the most to the people I love. By night, I do the same for you, my new client.</p>
            <p>So, let's talk about your story.</p>
